**The challenge:** Create a resource for intermediate design-oriented developers who want to take their creative coding projects to the next level.

**The Solution:** A website and book (eventually) to document the process of making physical art pieces from digital generative designs. It will serve as both a technical resource for creative coders and artistic inspiration for analog artists.

Website coming soon (April 2021)
