Iâ€™m Fiona, a senior at Northeastern University studying Computer Science and Graphic Design. My academic and professional motivation originates from my desire to improve the lives of others and protect the environment for future generations. I want to contribute to projects that are mission-driven and aimed at solving environmental issues and social inequalities.

When I'm not working, I'm probably listening to music and learning an obscure skill or hobby. Most recently I've learned how to make vegan cheese, grow hydroponic kale, and silkscreen print on clay.

I'm currently looking for full-time employment opportunities beginning May 2021, and am strongly interested in relocation. Don't hesitate to [reach out!](mailto:gridley.f@northeastern.edu)
